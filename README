An offwhite version of baycomb.vim, with subtle background shading on syntax.
This is basically a mix between my latest colorscheme, baycomb, and TaQua, by Eustaquio Rangel de Oliveira Jr. 

White backgrounds make it harder for me to identify normal text, and it seems harder to identify colors than on a dark background, so I added the soft glowing colors to syntax background. They may or may not be visible on your computer (they are too light to see on my computer at work; i adjusted them to be darker but then they were too dark and overpowering on my home computer).

The scheme has highlighting for both the GUI and Terminal. For tips and more information, go to baycomb's site:
